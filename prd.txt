Goal (one-sentence)
Expand this backend into a production-grade, RESTful API for a marketplace/e-commerce platform (Jumia-like) supporting sellers and buyers, robust product catalog (variants, SKUs), orders, payments, inventory, reviews, promotions, and a secure, well-documented API consumable by a TypeScript SPA or mobile apps.

📌 Deliverables (concrete)
Complete Django app(s) implementing models, serializers, views, and URL routes for the domain below.

API docs (OpenAPI/Swagger + ReDoc) fully documenting endpoints and request/response schemas.

DB migrations and a seed/fixture script to generate realistic demo data (categories, brands, products with variants, users, sellers, orders, reviews).

Postman/Insomnia collection (or OpenAPI clients) with example requests for major flows.

Automated tests: unit tests for serializers and models, integration tests for key endpoints and flows (cart → checkout → order → payment), and basic permission tests.

CI pipeline (GitHub Actions or similar) that runs tests, linting, and builds migrations.

Deployment guidance doc: environment variables, S3 setup, CDN, and recommended host (e.g. Render/Heroku/AWS ECS).

Performance & security checklist applied (indices, throttling, input validation, file upload limits, CORS, CSP, etc.).

🔧 Non-Functional Requirements
API style: RESTful (JSON), consistent status codes, structured error format. Use token-based auth (JWT access + refresh) for SPA; keep option for session auth.

Pagination: cursor or page (default page size 20) with links for next/previous.

Filtering & search: field filtering + full text search on name, description (Postgres full-text or Elasticsearch if needed).

Rate limiting / throttling: per-IP and per-user limits (configurable).

Media: product images stored in S3 (or equivalent), signed URLs if private; CDNs in front. Support image variants/sizes and automatic thumbnailing (Cloudinary or ImageKit optional).

Indexes: add DB indexes on fields used in filters/sorts (price, created_at, category_id, sku).

Transactions: order creation and stock decrement must be atomic.

Idempotency: for payment/order creation endpoints.

Security: input validation, limit upload size, auth on sensitive endpoints, permissions (seller vs admin vs customer). Use HTTPS in deployment.

Observability: basic logging, error tracking (Sentry), and metrics (Prometheus/Grafana recommended).

Testing coverage goal: ≥ 70% for backend logic and endpoints.

🧩 Data model (entities + cardinality)
Describe each model and relationship clearly so the engineer implements proper foreign keys, indices, and related_name values.

User (1)

roles/flags: is_customer, is_seller, is_staff

Cardinality: User 1 — many Orders; User 1 — many Reviews

Shop / SellerProfile (1)

belongs to one User (1:1) that is the seller account

Shop has many Products (1:N)

Shop has many Orders (via products or sales)

Cardinality: User 1 <-> 1 SellerProfile; SellerProfile 1 — many Products

🔐 Permissions & Roles
Anonymous: view public catalogs.

Customer: cart, checkout, reviews, profile, orders.

Seller: create/edit products, manage inventory, view sales/orders for their shop, shipping updates.

Staff/Admin: manage everything, create promotions, user management.

Implement object-level permissions so sellers can only modify products of their shop.

⚙️ Implementation & design notes (high yield)
Use Django REST Framework with ViewSets and Routers for consistency; use serializers with explicit read_only/write_only fields.

Use select_related & prefetch_related to avoid N+1 on product lists (product→brand, variant→images, variant→stock).

Use DB transactions (atomic) when creating orders and adjusting stock. Use select_for_update() when decrementing stock to avoid race conditions.

Use optimistic locking or reservation table if you want multi-step checkout with stock reservation.

Support idempotency-key header on payment/order endpoints.

For search, start with Postgres full-text search + trigram; allow plugging Elasticsearch for scale.

Throttle critical endpoints (checkout, login) and use CAPTCHA on registration if necessary.

For media, implement direct S3 uploads from client with pre-signed URLs to avoid proxying media through Django.

🧪 Testing / QA checklist
Unit tests for model constraints & serializers (unique SKU, review unique per user/product).

Integration tests for cart → checkout → payment flow, including a failed payment case and stock rollback.

Permission tests for seller vs customer actions.

API contract tests against OpenAPI schema.

Load test a catalog listing endpoint and checkout concurrency to validate stock locking.

🔁 Migration & seed data
Provide a management command manage.py seed_demo_data --count-products=500 --variants-per-product=3 that uses Faker to create realistic dataset (images can be placeholders).

Include migration plan for adding variants/sku if current production DB only has Product.

✅ Acceptance criteria (what 'done' looks like)
All endpoints in the deliverable list exist and are documented with request/response examples.

Demo seed data loads without errors.

Checkout flow works end-to-end in the sandbox (create order → pay via mocked provider → order state becomes paid → stock updated).

Tests pass in CI.

Admin can upload/update catalog and images.

Frontend TypeScript team can implement the storefront using only the provided API docs and examples.

Optional / stretch suggestions (nice-to-have)
Multi-vendor payout/split settlements.

Seller ratings & analytics dashboard.

Variant-level promotions.

Background workers (Celery + Redis) for sending emails, processing images, analytics.

GraphQL gateway for flexible frontend queries (optional).
Documentation requirements (Swagger / OpenAPI)
Must use drf-yasg (or drf-spectacular if preferred) to generate complete OpenAPI 3 documentation.

Every endpoint must have:

Summary & description explaining purpose and usage.

Tags grouping related endpoints (Auth, Catalog, Orders, Payments, etc.).

Parameter descriptions (query params, path params, request body schema).

Response schemas for success and error states with example JSON.

Authentication requirements (JWT bearer token) indicated in schema.

For list endpoints, include pagination schema and examples.

Schemas for all serializers should be automatically discoverable in Swagger UI.

Add operation_id and ref_name where needed to avoid schema collisions.

Serve Swagger UI at /swagger/ and ReDoc at /redoc/ in dev/staging.

Ensure docs auto-update as serializers/views change (use @swagger_auto_schema where custom actions are used).

Include end-to-end flow examples in Swagger — e.g., register → login → add to cart → checkout → payment.
